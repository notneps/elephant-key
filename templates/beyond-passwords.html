                <section class="beyond-passwords-text-1">
                    <p class="beyond-passwords-paragraph-1">Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is an additional layer of security that prevents a malicious actor who knows your password from logging into your account. Common types of 2FA are a code sent via SMS, generated by an app, or approving a login through another device. You can think of it this way: if a password is something that only you know, 2FA involves something that only you have. Almost all modern and responsibly administered services will allow you to enable some kind of 2FA. It’s probably the easiest, cheapest, and most powerful step you can take towards securing your accounts. Personally, I recommend Authy.</p>

                <section class="beyond-passwords-text-2">
                    <p class="beyond-passwords-paragraph-2">Be wary of logging onto sensitive accounts when using public computers. If someone has installed monitoring software on them, they can monitor your keystrokes and acquire your password. And even if the device you’re using doesn’t have malware on it, sneaky bad actors can always capture your keystrokes the analog way: with their eyes. Even in familiar places, look around and cover your hands when entering passwords.</p>

                <section class="beyond-passwords-text-3">
                    <p class="beyond-passwords-paragraph-3">Public WiFi is horribly insecure. You’re better off using your own data connection, especially if you need to log into an important account or deal with sensitive information. If you really must use an untrusted network, consider using a VPN (Virutal Private Network) which acts like a tunnel through the Public WiFi network, masking your traffic. Just make sure you trust your VPN provider though!</p>

                    <p class="beyond-passwords-paragraph-4">Maintain one (or more) email addresses to use with stuff other than your most important accounts. If a somewhat shady website needs your email, don’t give them the same email that you use for your online banking accounts! You can set up an alias to forward all email to one account, so you only need to check one inbox but have multiple addresses to use. If an account gets compromised, starts getting too much spam, or becomes unusable for some reason, you can ditch it without having to move everything to a new email address.</p>
